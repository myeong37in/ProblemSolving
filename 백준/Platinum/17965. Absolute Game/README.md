### 문제 설명

<p>Alice and Bob are playing a game. Alice has an array a of n integers, Bob has an array b of n integers. In each turn, a player removes one element of his array. Players take turns alternately. Alice goes first.</p>

<p>The game ends when both arrays contain exactly one element. Let x be the last element in Alice’s array and y be the last element in Bob’s array. Alice wants to maximize the absolute difference between x and y while Bob wants to minimize this value. Both players are playing optimally.</p>

<p>Find what will be the final value of the game.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1 000) — the number of values in each array.</p>

<p>The second line contains n space-separated integers a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, . . . , a<sub>n</sub> (1 ≤ a<sub>i</sub> ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>) — the numbers in Alice’s array.</p>

<p>The third line contains n space-separated integers b<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>2</sub>, . . . , b<sub>n</sub> (1 ≤ b<sub>i</sub> ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>) — the numbers in Bob’s array.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Print the absolute difference between x and y if both players are playing optimally.</p>
