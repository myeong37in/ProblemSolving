### 문제 설명

<p>Everybody is fond of computers, but buying a new one is always a money challenge. Fortunately, there is always a convenient way to deal with. You can replace your computer and get a brand new one, thus saving some maintenance cost. Of course, you must pay a fixed cost for each new computer you get.</p>

<p>Suppose you are considering a n year period over which you want to have a computer. Suppose you buy a new computer in year y, 1<=y<=n. Then you have to pay a fixed cost c, in the year y, and a maintenance cost m(y,z) each year you own that computer, starting from year y through the year z, z<=n, when you plan to buy - eventually - another computer.</p>

<p>Write a program that computes the minimum cost of having a computer over the n year period.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The program input is from a text file. Each data set in the file stands for a particular set of costs. A data set starts with the cost c for getting a new computer. Follows the number n of years, and the maintenance costs m(y,z), y=1..n, z=y..n. The program prints the minimum cost of having a computer throughout the n year period.</p>

<p>White spaces can occur freely in the input. The input data are correct and terminate with an end of file.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each set of data the program prints the result to the standard output from the beginning of a line.</p>
